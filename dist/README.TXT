Welcome to jGlacier 0.1, an open source JAVA client for Amazon Glacier.
Before you start, you have to create a file 'credentials.json' in your WORKING DIRECTORY.

You have to type your credentials for Amazon Glacier in this file to authenticate on the service like this example:
{"accessKey":"*** YOUR ACCESS KEY ***","secretKey":"*** YOUR SECRET KEY ***"}

Now just start the application and upload your files!
